An interactive 3D particle visualization built with Three.js and GSAP. This project features a dynamic particle system that can smoothly morph between a spherical distribution and custom text input, complete with interactive controls and fluid animations.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive 3D Sphere**: A mesmerizing particle sphere that responds to mouse interactions.
- **Text Morphing**: Type any text and watch the particles fluidly rearrange themselves to form the letters.
- **Dynamic Color System**: 
  - Real-time color customization via a sleek color picker.
  - Adaptive HSL-based color themes that maintain visual depth.
- **Mouse Interaction**:
  - Rotate the sphere by dragging.
  - Text tracks mouse movement for a 3D parallax effect.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: For 3D graphics rendering and particle system management.
- **[GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/)**: For high-performance, smooth animations between states.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Core logic and event handling.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Structure and modern, glassmorphic UI overlay.
